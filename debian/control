Description: MPEG-2/H.264/H.265 frame-accurate video cutter
 TTCut-ng is a video cutting tool for MPEG-2, H.264, and H.265 streams that
 avoids re-encoding the entire video. Only frames around cut points are
 selectively re-encoded (Smart Cut).
 .
 It was designed primarily for removing commercials from DVB recordings.
 Frame-accurate cutting is possible at any position.
 .
 Features:
  - MPEG-2: Classic TTCut cutting with ffmpeg
  - H.264/H.265: Smart Cut (~0.5% re-encode, ~99.5% stream-copy)
  - SRT subtitle support with preview
  - MKV output with chapter support
