# Code Map Index — TTCut-ng

Maintained architecture/data-flow maps. See the `code-map` skill for how these are
created, checked for staleness, and updated. **Before answering an architecture or
data-flow question, check here first.**

## Detail maps

| Map | Subsystem | base_commit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [frame-order.md](frame-order.md) | Frame-order pipeline: still-image display vs cut-set vs smart-cut execution; decode-order vs display-order semantics | `eff8dfa` | fresh (run `code-map check` to verify) |

## Project module overview

Not yet generated. Run `code-map index` to build the coarse module/class
responsibility overview + top-level Mermaid diagram. Until then, the per-subsystem
detail maps above are the authoritative source; the existing
`memory/architecture_*.md` notes (TTSettings, TTSearchTask, cutVideoName split)
also cover specific areas.

## Project-wide redundancy patterns

Collected from detail maps as they are created. From `frame-order.md`:
- Three ad-hoc decode-order↔display-time conversions (`onPlayVideo`,
  `onPlaybackFinished`, `onPlaybackPositionChanged`) — candidate for a shared
  `decodeIndexToDisplaySeconds` / `displaySecondsToDecodeIndex` helper.
